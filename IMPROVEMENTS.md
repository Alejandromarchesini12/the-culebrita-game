# Ideas and Improvements for The Culebrita Game

## Possible Enhancements

1. **Multiple Mazes**
   - Add 10 different maze layouts.
   - Randomly select a maze each time the game starts for increased replayability.

2. **Increasing Difficulty**
   - Make the snake move faster each time it eats food or after reaching certain point thresholds.

3. **Power-Ups and Obstacles**
   - Add power-ups (e.g., temporary invincibility, slow down time, bonus points).
   - Introduce new obstacles (e.g., moving cacti, walls that appear/disappear).

4. **Sound Effects and Music**
   - Add background music and sound effects for eating, game over, etc.

5. **High Score Tracking**
   - Save and display the highest score achieved.

6. **Improved Graphics**
   - Use more advanced graphics or animations for the snake, food, and obstacles.

7. **Customizable Controls**
   - Allow players to remap movement keys.

8. **Pause and Resume**
   - Add the ability to pause and resume the game.

9. **Levels and Progression**
   - Add levels with increasing complexity and new challenges.

10. **Mobile or Web Version**
    - Port the game to run on mobile devices or as a web app.

## Code Quality Suggestions
- Refactor code for modularity (separate logic, graphics, input handling).
- Add more comments and documentation for maintainability.
- Write unit tests for core logic (if possible).
